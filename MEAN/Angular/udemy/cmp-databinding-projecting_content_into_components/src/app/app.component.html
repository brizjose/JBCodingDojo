<!-- binding [element] that is an @Input() in a child component, app-server-element component, to each particular serverElement of the serverElements array in the app.component -->
<!-- binding (createdServer) that is an @Output() of a child component, cockpit.component.  This triggers a method to which we pass the $event.  The $event is parsed easily thanks to the use of data structure {name:string, content:string} that is present in the event emitter as well as in the method parameters -->

<!-- #paragraph is a hook that will be used by server-element.component to access the values emanating from here @ViewChild won't work there because it is not part of the tempalte, it is just being projected unto its <ng-content> section of its html.   therefore, the use of @ContentChild...   here we see the difference between ViewInit and ContentInit cycles. -->
