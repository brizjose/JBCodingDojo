// classical vs prototypical inheritance

// classical creates instances of a template, used in older languages --> build a house from an architectural diagram

// prototypical inheritance copies another object --> building a house from another house

// JS uses prototypical inheritance.  
// if it is said there is JS classical inheritance, it is because on code it looks like it, but it really is prototypical
// so, in JS there is:
// 1. pseudo-classical pattern (code looks classical)
// 2. prototypal pattern
