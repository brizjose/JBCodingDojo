Steps:

1. Created a Github repository called basic_repo 
2. Created a local folder with the same name
3. While in the folder, created a local repository with command >git init 
4. Locally created three text files and added content to them
5. Added the files to staging with command >git add .
6. Linked the Github and local repositories with the command >git remote add origin url
7. Tried to push something to Github and got errors because I had not committed anything locally
8. Made first commit with command >git commit -m "initial commit"
9. Pushed local commit to Github repository by copying and pasting the command from Github, it worked this time
10. Checked git status with >git status, which came out clean
11. Forgot where I was, so checked with >git branch and got response of *master (yeah, have not created any branches)
12. Made changes to one of the files, then added it to git staging, then committed
13. Pushed new commit to Github with command >git push master origin
14. And yes, looking goog at Github.com
