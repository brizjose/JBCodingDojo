Django ORM

Objects are created in models.py then imported to views.py

  # Inside models.py
  from __future__ import unicode_literals
  from django.db import models
  # Create your models here.

  class Blog(models.Model):
      name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
      desc = models.TextField()
      created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add = True)
      updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now = True)
      def__repr__(self):
	return "<Blog object: {} {}>".format(self.name, self.desc)
  class Comment(models.Model):
      comment = models.CharField(max_length=255)
      created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add = True)
      updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now = True)
	# Notice the association made with ForeignKey for a one-to-many relationship
      	# There can be many comments to one blog
      blog = models.ForeignKey(Blog, related_name = "comments")
      
  class Admin(models.Model):
      first_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
      last_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
      email = models.CharField(max_length=255)
      # Following is an example of a many to many relationship
      # Notice blogs is plural as well as its related_anme admins
      blogs = models.ManyToManyField(Blog, related_name = "admins")
      created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add = True)
      updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now = True)
      def__repr__(self):
	return "<Admin: {} {}>".format(self.first_name, self.last_name)

Note:  the def__repr__(self):  method is helpful as this is the info about the object that will get printed on queries, instead of the <objea;sldkj>. 


Column Types:

	models.CharField -- has a required parameter max_length
	models.TextField -- has no maximum length
	models.IntegerField
	models.BooleanField
	models.DateTimeField -- can take parameter to auto populate it upon creation of record:  auto_now_add=True which is useful for created_at
				-- can take one that auto updates any time the object is modified:  auto_now=True which is useful for updated_at
	models.ForeignKey  -- these go in the "many" side, just like in SQL -- models.ForeignKey(Blog, related_name="comments")
	models.ManyToManyField -- use in the many side that makes more sense -- models.ManyToManyField(Blog, related_name="admins")
	models.OneToOneField

Migrations

Necessary when database are set up and every time they are updated:

	>python manage.py makemigrations  	--- stages the changes
	>python manage.py migrate		--- applies the changes

Database

during production, Django uses SQLite
for deployment, better switch to MySQL

The Django ORM queries will be the same no matter which database is used

Python Shell

-python shell helps navigate objects

	>python manage.py shell

-import one or many models

	>from apps.{{app_name}}.models import *   ---- or replace * with specific models you want to work with, example Author, Book, Publisher


ORM Commands

1. Creating a new record:
	
	Blog.objects.create(name="Coding Dojo", desc="cool lectures")

2. Alternative way of creating a new record

	b = Blog(name="Coding Dojo", desc="cool lectures")
	b.name = "Coding Dojo"
	b.desc = "cool lectures"
	b.save()

3. Retrieve

	Blog.objects.get(id=#)
	Blog.objects.first()
	Blog.objects.last()
	Blog.objects.all()
	Blog.objects.count()
	Blog.objects.filter(name="Fred")
	Blog.objects.exclude(name="Bambi")
	Blog.objects.order_by("created_at")
	Blog.objects.order_by("-created_at")  -- revereses the order
	Blog.objects.raw(SELECT * FROM {{ app name }}_{{ class or table name }})  -- use raw SQL queries
	Blog.objects.first().comments.all()    ---get all comments from first blog
	Blog.objects.get(id=14).comments.first()   ---get the first comment of blog # 14
	Comment.objects.get(id=15).blog.name   ---get blog name where comment id#15 was posted
	Admin.objects.filter(first_name__startswith="S")   ---filters objects with first_name that starts with "S"
	Admin.objects.exclude(first_name__contains="E")   ---excludes objects where first_name contains "E"
	Admin.objects.filter(age__gt=80)    ---filters objects with age greater than 80

4.  Combining and assigning:   it can get complicated.   if too complicated, best to use raw queries
	
	admin = Admin.objects.filter(last_name__contains="o").exclude(first_name__contains="o")
	admin = Admin.objects.filter(age__lt=70)|Admin.objects.filter(first_name__startswith="S")

	
5. Update
	
	b = Blog.objects.first()
	b.name = "JinjaExpert"
	b.save()

6. Delete record

	b = Blog.objects.get(id=3)
	b.delete()

7. Set a relationship

	Comment.objects.create(blog = Blog.objects.get(id=15), comment = "test")   ---creates new comment pointing to Blog id # 15
