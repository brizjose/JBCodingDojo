Session

Session in Django gets saved even if we leave the browser

1. 
run the following commands in the directory withere manage.py resides, this makes session available:

  # Need to be in same directory as manage.py file
  > python manage.py makemigrations
  > python manage.py migrate

2.
request.session is a key:value dictionary;  the capture from forms occurs in the views.py with some methods with example syntax:

request.session['name'] = request.POST['name']
request.session['counter'] = 100

3.
in the html file, these are accessible as dictionaries:

{{ request.session.name }}

4.
some useful methods:

request.session['key']  ---retrieve (get) the value stored in ['key']

request.session['key'] - 'value'  ---set the value that will be stored by ['key']

del request.session['key']  ---deletes a session key if it exists, throws a keyError if it does not.  Use along with 'try' and 'except' since it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission

'key' in request.session  ---returns a boolean of whether a key is in session or not

{{ request.session.name }}  ---use dot notation (.) to access request.session keys from templates since square brackets [] aren't allowed there
