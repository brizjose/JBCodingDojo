Conventions
We will be following a set of conventions to create our database.

1.
make the table name plural and ALL lowercase - make it plural (ex. users, leads, sites, clients, chapters, courses, modules)

2.
use "id" as the primary key - name it id (also make it auto-incremented).

3.
name foreign keys with singular_table_name_id when referencing to a primary key in another table name it [singular name of the table you're referring to]_id (ex. user_id, lead_id, site_id, client_id, chapter_id, course_id, module_id).

4.
use created_at and updated_at as columns for the timestamp in EVERY table you create.
