1. What query would you run to get the total revenue for March of 2012?

SELECT SUM(amount) AS Total_Revenue_March_2012

FROM billing

WHERE charged_datetime 
LIKE "2012-03%";

2. What query would you run to get total revenue collected from the client with an id of 2?

SELECT SUM(amount) AS Total_Collected_From_ID_2

FROM billing

JOIN clients ON billing.client_id = clients.client_id

WHERE clients.client_id = 2;

3. What query would you run to get all the sites that client=10 owns?

SELECT sites.domain_name AS Client_10_Sites

FROM sites

WHERE sites.client_id = 10;

4. What query would you run to get total # of sites created per month per year for the client with an id of 1? What about for client=20?

SELECT MONTH(sites.created_datetime) AS Month, YEAR(sites.created_datetime) AS Year, (sites.domain_name) AS Client_1_Sites

FROM sites

WHERE sites.client_id = 1

GROUP BY MONTH(sites.created_datetime);

5. What query would you run to get the total # of leads generated for each of the sites between January 1, 2011 to February 15, 2011?

SELECT DATE_FORMAT(leads.registered_datetime, '%M %d %Y') AS Date, sites.domain_name AS Site, COUNT(leads.leads_id) as Leads

FROM leads

JOIN sites ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id

WHERE DATE(leads.registered_datetime) BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2011-02-15'

GROUP BY Site

ORDER BY Leads DESC;

6. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients 
between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011?

SELECT CONCAT_WS(' ', clients.first_name, clients.last_name) AS Client, COUNT(leads.leads_id) as Leads

FROM clients

JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id

JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id

WHERE DATE(leads.registered_datetime) BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2011-12-31'

GROUP BY Client

ORDER BY Leads DESC;

7. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads 
we've generated for each client each month between months 1 - 6 of Year 2011?

SELECT CONCAT_WS(' ', clients.first_name, clients.last_name) AS Client, MONTHNAME(leads.registered_datetime) AS '2011 Month', 
COUNT(leads.leads_id) as Leads

FROM clients

JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id

JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id

WHERE DATE(leads.registered_datetime) BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2011-06-30'

GROUP BY Client

ORDER BY Leads DESC;

8. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients' sites 
between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011? 
Order this query by client id.  
Come up with a second query that shows all the clients, the site name(s), and the total number of leads generated from each site for all time.

SELECT clients.client_id AS Client_ID, CONCAT_WS(' ', clients.first_name, clients.last_name) AS Client, 
COUNT(leads.leads_id) as '2011 Leads'
FROM clients

JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id

JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id

WHERE DATE(leads.registered_datetime) BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2011-12-31'

GROUP BY Client

ORDER BY CLient_ID;

SELECT clients.client_id AS Client_ID, CONCAT_WS(' ', clients.first_name, clients.last_name) AS Client, 
COUNT(leads.leads_id) as All_Time_Leads

FROM clients

JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id

JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id

GROUP BY Client

ORDER BY CLient_ID;

9. Write a single query that retrieves total revenue collected from each client for each month of the year. Order it by client id.

SELECT clients.client_id AS Client_ID, CONCAT_WS(' ', clients.first_name, clients.last_name) AS Client, 
FORMAT(SUM(billing.amount),2) as Revenue, MONTH(billing.charged_datetime) AS Month, YEAR(billing.charged_datetime) AS Year

FROM clients

JOIN billing ON billing.client_id = clients.client_id

GROUP BY Month

ORDER BY CLient_ID;

10. Write a single query that retrieves all the sites that each client owns. Group the results so that each row shows a new client. 
It will become clearer when you add a new field called 'sites' that has all the sites that the client owns. (HINT: use GROUP_CONCAT)

SELECT clients.client_id AS Client_ID, CONCAT_WS(' ', clients.first_name, clients.last_name) AS Client, 
GROUP_CONCAT(sites.domain_name) AS Sites

FROM clients

JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id

GROUP BY Client

ORDER BY CLient_ID;
