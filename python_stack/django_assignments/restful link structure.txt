RESTFUL LINKS STRUCTURE
1.
a GET request to /users - calls the index method to display all the users. This will need a template.
2.
GET request to /users/new - calls the new method to display a form allowing users to create a new user. This will need a template.
3.
GET request /users/<id>/edit - calls the edit method to display a form allowing users to edit an existing user with the given id. This will need a template.
4.
GET /users/<id> - calls the show method to display the info for a particular user with given id. This will need a template.
5.
POST to /users/create - calls the create method to insert a new user record into our database. This POST should be sent from the form on the page /users/new. Have this redirect to /users/<id> once created.
6.
GET /users/<id>/destroy - calls the destroy method to remove a particular user with the given id. Have this redirect back to /users once deleted.
7.
POST /users/update - calls the update method to process the submitted form sent from /users/<id>/edit. Have this redirect to /users/<id> once updated.

Notice that for every form submission we use a POST method, while we're rendering our templates from get routes.
