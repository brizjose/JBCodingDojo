pip

While working as a developer, you'll find yourself wanting to use some functionality that is not included in your language's standard library.
However, as a language grows and is used for more purposes, developers build their own tools and package them for use by others. 
These are known as third party modules. Pip is the package manager we use in Python to install these modules. 
Installing third party modules is very simple, because pip does a great job at knowing which version of that package we need to match our Python version. 

1. install

$ pip install {{name_of_module}} <= NOTE: substitute [name_of_module] with the module you are installing!
#example:
$ pip install Flask

2. uninstall

$ pip uninstall {{name_of_module}} <= NOTE: substitute {{name_of_module}} with the module you are removing!
#example:
$ pip uninstall Flask
