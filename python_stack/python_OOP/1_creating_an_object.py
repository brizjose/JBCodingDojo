#declare a class with class className (parameter):

class User(object):
    pass

#the parameter object means that class User inherits from object class.

#we can make instances --objects-- of this class:

helen = User()
mikel = User()

#think of class as blueprint and objects as versions of the blueprint

#classes include:

# Attributes - characteristics they have, shared by all instances of the class.  example, they have a name and email
# Methods - actions an object can perform.  a function that belongs to a class.  example, users can purchase

#objects have two important features:

# storage of information
# ability to execute some logic
