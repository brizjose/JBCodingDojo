OOP - Object Oriented Programming

Create blueprints for the elements, each with things they have and things they do...

Each blueprint is a CLASS
what they have is called ATTRIBUTES
what they can do is called METHODS

Each object created using the blueprint is called an INSTANCE

each INSTANCE = OBJECT
with INSTANCE ATTRIBUTES and INSTANCE METHODS

METHODS and ATTRIBUTES can be PRIVATE, and they become unavailable to the INSTANCES
only available if they are PUBLIC

CONSTRUCTOR is a method that creates OBJECTs
DESTRUCTUOR is a method that is run when an OBJECT is erased from memory

OBJECTs can generate other versions of itself or upgrade with additional attributes and methods from the base OBJECT
with upgraded objects, the CLASS can INHERIT all PUBLIC attributes from the parent, plus have their own. 
apart from PUBLIC and PRIVATE methods, there are PROTECTED methods that do get inherited but remain hidden from public

OOP (Object Oriented Programming) is something that has revolutionized the way programming is done today. 
If used correctly, it can save you loads of time. 
It will also help you to avoid repeating code that solves the same simple problem, making code maintenance easy. 

Understanding object-oriented programming principles is the key to making your code more organized and modular.

OOP is used in web development as a way of producing many copies of similar objects.
